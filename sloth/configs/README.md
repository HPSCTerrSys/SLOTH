# sloth/configs/
Here are some config files stored which are needed by SLOTH.   

So for example grid definition (`griddes`) files as created by 
`CDO griddes INFILE` and a table with needed parameters to define all CORDEX 
domains.   

## Source
- `CordexGrid.conf`: [Link](http://is-enes-data.github.io/cordex_archive_specifications.pdf)
- `DE06_griddes.txt`: created by ABE (a.belleflamme@fz-juelich.de)  
- `pEU3_griddes.txt`: created by NWR (n.wagner@fz-juelich.de)
