# Examples

This directory contains small examples that explain different features / aspects of SLOTH.   
The aim of these examples is to give a little more insight than just reading the technical documentation. An example is not necessarily about a specific method in SLOTH, but also about problems you could solve with one or more methods of SLOTH. These examples should help others to solve similar problems more quickly.    

How to contribute your own example is described in the [How to contribute](../content/maintenance.md#how-to-contribute) section.
