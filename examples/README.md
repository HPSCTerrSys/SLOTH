**Example scripts showing what is possible with SLOTH**   

**To be changed! Use .ipynb!**

Each script located within this directory does show a usecase and introcudes 
how to use individual methods of **SLOTH** to solve the indicates problem.  
In all scripts a lot of comments are used serving as tutorial / user-guide.  
Next to many scripts a equal named plot is placed, created by the scritp itself and showing what to expect from the script -- kind of helping to brows through the availabale scritps.  

All scripts are running out of the box on JSC machines (JUWELS and JURECA) as a sample data-set is provided under `/p/scratch/cslts/shared_data/tmp_TestData` which is used by all the example scripts here. This ensures that everyone can clone this repo and directly start testing stuff, without the need to find all dependencies and correct datasets beforhand.  

Even if this directry does contain example scripts showing how to use methods of **SLOTH** the idea of developing **SLOTH** is the other way around. Everything taks with the potential to contribute to **SLOTH** which is coming up in the future, should be solved in a example scripte here. Than, the core-methods which turns out to be essential and resuable by other should be extracted and added to the core-methods of **SLOTH** under the `sloth/` directory.  
This is because many times a 'ready to use' function is hard to imaging beforhand and essential elements does show up with some time only.
