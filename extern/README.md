## external repositories / submoduls
**SLOTH** is not aimed to reinvent the wheel but to make use of already developed tools and to add missing methods and functions where needed.  
Therefore this directory does contain / is linking to other repositories which does hold useful functionality. Those methods are then integrated within **SLOTH**, to most efficiently use and combine already developed tools.  

External git-repositories which are stored inside another git-repository are called `submodules`. So this external repositories are the reason why one have to spend a littel extra effort in cloning the **SLOTH** repository.
